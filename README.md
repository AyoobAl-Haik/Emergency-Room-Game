### Small Immediate Plans (REMOVE WHEN SUBMITTING)
- **1.** add random chance for new patient to enter waiting list, add turn limit so game ends after some turns w/ some way to get scored for success/failure ("shift ends")
- **2.** add consciousness mechanic when patient codes (will play into symptoms/signs mechanic added later)
- **3.** 
### Big Next Steps (REMOVE WHEN SUBMITTING)
- **1.** add non-lifethreatening afflictions (colds,minor cuts, etc.)
- **2.** make it so player isn't told what affliction is, force player to use diagnostics/symptoms
- **3.** add options to interact with other hospital departments that interact with emergency dept. (radiology for diagnostics, surgery to cure certain afflictions, etc.)
- **4.** 
# Project Title

A game that simulates an emergency room. Patients will come in with afflictions that the player will have to treat. Players will have to make decisions on who to treat given the severity of their condition and deal with the limitations of having a finite number of bays.

## Biomedical Context

A game like this can be used as a training aid to better understand triage and patient management. This would ideally be used as an interactive way for medical students interested in working in emergency medicine to practice these skills.

## Usage Guide

[Step-by-step explanation with screenshots or text]

- **Step 1:** patients will arrive into the emergency room and be put on the waitlist.patients can be moved from the waitlist into one of 3 bays.
- **Step 2:** From there, treatments can be applied. Applying the correct treatment in time will remove the affliction on the patient
- **Step 3:** patients who are sucessfully treated can get discharged. Less fortunate patients are sent to the morgue
